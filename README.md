# Designing-robotic-vehicle-for-disaster-relief
An in-depth hands-on design project which analyzes different iterations of a robotic vehicle design for disaster relief. End product is designed, programmed, and crafted from scratch and has been validated to be capable of travelling through rough terrains modelled by obstacles such as going up and down a 45-degree slope and subsequently stopping before a wall.
